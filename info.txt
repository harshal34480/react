1. what is emmet?
-> Emmet is a tool that helps web developers write HTML and CSS code more quickly and efficiently.
   It's a shorthand syntax that allows you to type abbreviations and then expand them into full HTML or CSS code.
   This can save a lot of time and reduce the amount of manual typing needed when creating web pages.

2. differnce between library and framework?
->  library is collection of pacakages that perform specific operation.
    whereas a framework contains the basic flow and architechture of an application.
    The major difference between them is the complexity. Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code.
    React js is library and Angular is Framework.
    The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. 
    If a library is used, the application calls the code from the library.
